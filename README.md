# Games
i'll be creating some games next weeks because of the college so thi'll be the repository to store these.

## Tecnologies
 - C++ Programming Language
 - SFML a C++ Library

## Repository
Every game'll be a branch in this repository, so every branch tell a story of a game creation.

## Structure
I have coding xp with web development so i usually like to divide the code in multiple files to let it easy to read (in my opinion), so every game'll follow the structure:

- **Root**
  - **include**
    - Header Files
  - **src**
    - main.cpp
    - **Game**
      - Player.cpp
  - **assets**
    - images
    - sounds
    - fonts 

I'll be updating this file to tell the structure folder of the games.

## Variable Names
This's the pollemic part! OKay i know the c++ programmers usually like to create variables like m_something, but i do not like this. Working with a team i would accept the variable names convention, but this project's mine. In this case, you can expect this pattern:

### Classes Names
 - Capital Letter in the beggining like: Game or GameTest

###  Everything Else
 - Capital letter from the seccond word, like gameLoop() or playerMove.
