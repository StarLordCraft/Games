# First Game
This is my official first game using C++, obviously this gonna be simple and maybe boring, but everyone has a start!

## CONCEPT
Create a simple game to test the library, it wont'll have a lot of textures, i'm thinking in something simple as some squares in the screen or another geometrics.

The interactivity'll be some clicks on the screen.
